# PCS Architecture Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Conformance Standard  

---

## 1. Abstract

Persistent Cognitive Substrate (PCS) defines a conformance standard for systems that maintain persistent cognitive state across session boundaries, inference engine transitions, and node failures. PCS specifies deterministic interfaces for state persistence, governance enforcement, replication, and cryptographic attestation. Conformance is validated through a reproducible test suite with binary assertions and stable evidence hashes.

PCS does not prescribe internal implementation details. It defines externally observable invariants that must hold regardless of inference engine, deployment topology, or integration depth. A conformant implementation demonstrates that cognitive state remains stable and enforceable independent of probabilistic inference components.

---

## 2. System Model

### 2.1 Architectural Separation

PCS defines a strict separation between:
	1.	Deterministic State Layer
Responsible for persistent storage, policy enforcement, state export/import, and hash attestation.
	2.	Probabilistic Inference Engine
Responsible for generating responses based on inputs and provided context.

The inference engine is treated as a replaceable component. PCS does not require any specific model architecture, training methodology, or vendor implementation.

### 2.2 Control Plane and Data Plane

PCS implementations MUST expose deterministic interfaces for:
	•	state export,
	•	state import (REPLACE semantics),
	•	state hash computation,
	•	invocation routing,
	•	health verification.

These interfaces operate independently of inference engine internals.

Inference engines MAY consume cognitive state through integration mechanisms defined in Section 9.5. However, state persistence and governance invariants MUST NOT depend on model-specific behavior.

### 2.3 Determinism Requirements

All state exported by a PCS implementation MUST be:
	•	canonically encoded,
	•	timestamp-free,
	•	platform-independent,
	•	stable under repeated serialization.

Hash values derived from exported state MUST be identical across compliant platforms when state is identical.

Deterministic behavior is evaluated through conformance testing, not implementation inspection.

---

## 3. Deterministic State Interfaces

### 3.1 Export and Import Semantics

A PCS implementation MUST provide:
	•	Export: Returns the complete canonical representation of cognitive state.
	•	Import: Replaces existing cognitive state with the provided canonical representation.
	•	Hash: Returns a cryptographic digest derived exclusively from canonical export.

Import operations MUST use REPLACE semantics. Partial merges, conflict resolution policies, or background reconciliation mechanisms are outside the scope of PCS L4.

### 3.2 Replication Model (L4)

Replication, where applicable, is mediated externally via explicit export/import operations. PCS does not require background synchronization, polling, quorum coordination, or eventual consistency mechanisms.

Convergence is verified through immediate hash equality checks.

### 3.3 Evidence Contract

Each conformance scenario produces:
	•	binary pass/fail assertions,
	•	canonical state hashes,
	•	structured evidence bundles.

Evidence hashes MUST remain stable across repeated executions under identical conditions. Bundle hashes MAY vary where execution metadata differs.

Conformance validation relies exclusively on observable outputs and hash attestation.

---

## 4. Cognitive State Semantics

PCS defines a formal state model for persistent cognitive artifacts. These artifacts are stored and governed deterministically by the state layer.

### 4.1 Decisions

A Decision is a persistent state artifact representing a resolved determination or committed outcome.

Decisions MUST:
	•	be uniquely identifiable,
	•	persist across sessions,
	•	survive inference engine replacement (L3),
	•	replicate across nodes (L4).

Decision identity MUST be stable under identical content and nonce inputs. A Decision is not a transient instruction to the inference engine; it is a durable record of resolved cognitive state.

### 4.2 Policies

A Policy is a persistent state artifact representing a constraint or governance rule applied to subsequent inference operations. Policies MUST be:
	•	persistently stored independent of the inference engine,
	•	deterministically enforced across engine transitions,
	•	identified by stable policy identifiers derived from their canonical content.

Policies govern inference behavior but are not themselves inference results. They represent deterministic constraints on probabilistic processes.

### 4.3 Cognitive Identity

Cognitive Identity is defined as the continuity of decisions and policies across inference engine transitions.

A conformant PCS implementation at L3 MUST preserve decision and policy identity when the inference engine is replaced, without re-seeding state.

Identity preservation is evaluated through stable identifiers and enforcement behavior, not through internal model introspection.

### 4.4 Governance Invariants

The following invariants MUST hold for L3 and L4 conformance:
	•	Decisions persist independent of inference engine implementation.
	•	Policies are enforced deterministically independent of inference engine implementation.
	•	State identity remains stable across engine transitions.
	•	State survives single-node loss in a three-node topology (L4).

These invariants are verified through reproducible conformance scenarios and hash attestation.

## 5. Conformance Levels

PCS defines incremental conformance levels. Each level introduces additional invariants while preserving all guarantees of preceding levels. Conformance is demonstrated exclusively through the Conformance Test Suite (CTS) and validated by binary assertions and evidence hashes.

### 5.1 L1 — Persistent State

Guarantee: Cognitive state persists across session boundaries.

A conformant L1 implementation MUST:
	•	persist Decisions and Policies durably,
	•	restore state on process restart,
	•	produce identical canonical exports before and after restart.

L1 establishes durability. It does not address governance enforcement, engine transitions, or distributed survivability.

### 5.2 L2 — Deterministic Governance

Guarantee: Policy enforcement is deterministic.

A conformant L2 implementation MUST:
	•	enforce Policies through deterministic routing or mediation,
	•	demonstrate stable enforcement behavior under repeated execution,
	•	produce stable evidence hashes for identical inputs.

L2 introduces governance invariants but does not require engine independence.

### 5.3 L3 — Engine-Independent Cognitive Continuity

Guarantee: Cognitive state is independent of the inference engine.

A conformant L3 implementation MUST:
	•	preserve Decision identity across inference engine replacement,
	•	preserve Policy identity and enforcement semantics across engine replacement,
	•	demonstrate stable evidence hashes across engine transitions.

At L3, the inference engine becomes a replaceable component. Cognitive state continuity is verified through CTS scenarios involving explicit engine transitions.

### 5.4 L4 — Federated Survivability

Guarantee: Cognitive state survives single-node loss in a minimal multi-node topology.

L4 does not require:
	•	quorum-based consensus,
	•	partition tolerance,
	•	majority-node-loss survivability,
	•	background replication,
	•	eventual consistency semantics.

A conformant L4 implementation MUST:
	•	replicate canonical state across a three-node topology (N=3) via explicit export/import,
	•	survive loss of any single node (tolerate 1/3 failure),
	•	preserve pre-existing Decisions and Policies after one node is terminated,
	•	accept new writes on surviving nodes after node loss,
	•	converge via immediate hash equality verification (no polling, no eventual consistency waits).

L4 implementations MUST NOT:
	•	implement background replication daemons,
	•	use polling loops or timing-based convergence checks,
	•	expose peer-awareness or cluster membership APIs,
	•	add endpoints beyond the five required PCS interfaces.

L4 establishes distributed survivability under controlled, deterministic replication mediated by the CTS.

### Level Progression Model

Each level adds one category of invariant:

Level     Invariant                    Validated By 
L1        Durability                   State recovery after process restart
L2        Deterministic Governance     Stable enforcement under repeated execution
L3        Engine Independence          Identity preservation across engine swap
L4        Federated Survivability      State survival after node termination

The conformance suite evaluates these invariants through reproducible scenarios and cryptographic attestation. Implementations MAY exceed these guarantees but MUST satisfy the defined invariants to claim conformance.

## 6. Evidence Contract

PCS conformance is established exclusively through cryptographically verifiable evidence artifacts.
Behavioral claims are insufficient without attestation.

A PCS implementation MUST produce evidence bundles for each conformance scenario executed by the Conformance Test Suite (CTS). Each bundle MUST contain sufficient material to independently verify that the required invariants were satisfied.

L4 conformance includes automated scope-enforcement tests (“tripwires”) that detect prohibited patterns such as background replication, polling-based convergence, or peer-awareness semantics. Tripwires MUST pass for any L4 conformance claim.

Platform Invariance
A conformant implementation MUST produce identical evidence_hash values across supported runtime versions when executing identical scenarios under identical conditions.

### 6.1 Evidence Bundles

An Evidence Bundle is a structured artifact generated by the CTS during scenario execution.

An Evidence Bundle MUST include:
	•	scenario identifier,
	•	conformance level,
	•	ordered execution phases,
	•	assertion outcomes (binary pass/fail),
	•	canonical state exports (where applicable),
	•	node hash values (where applicable),
	•	normalized evidence hash.

Evidence Bundles MAY include additional trace data for debugging purposes, but conformance determination MUST rely only on the normalized evidence set.

### 6.2 Canonical State Export

Canonical state export defines the deterministic serialization of cognitive state.

A conformant implementation MUST:
	•	export state in canonical JSON form,
	•	lexicographically sort keys,
	•	exclude timestamps and environment-specific metadata,
	•	include a schema_version field,
	•	ensure identical logical state produces identical canonical exports.

The canonical export is the sole input to hash computation.

### 6.3 Evidence Hash

Each scenario execution produces a deterministic evidence_hash defined as:

evidence_hash = SHA256(normalized_evidence_bundle)

The normalized evidence bundle MUST:
	•	exclude nondeterministic runtime metadata,
	•	include only assertion-relevant fields,
	•	be stable across identical executions.

Repeated execution of an identical scenario under identical inputs MUST produce an identical evidence_hash.

If identical runs produce differing evidence_hash values, the implementation is nonconformant.

A reference L4 baseline (2026-02-15) produced:
sha256:9df56b940ded1689af9903bdfe7dbe3bee5efa3f3b68d757bcf89467d3285c6f

Future conformant implementations MUST produce a stable evidence_hash under identical scenarios, but are not required to match this reference value if implementation details differ while preserving all invariants.

### 6.4 Bundle Hash

In addition to the evidence_hash, implementations MAY compute a bundle_hash that includes the full raw artifact set.

The bundle_hash serves forensic and archival purposes and MAY vary across runs due to timestamps or environment metadata. Conformance evaluation MUST rely on the evidence_hash, not the bundle_hash.

### 6.5 Binary Assertion Model

PCS conformance is evaluated exclusively through binary assertions.

Each scenario phase MUST produce explicit assertions such as:
	•	decision present: true/false
	•	policy enforced: true/false
	•	hash equality: true/false
	•	identity preserved: true/false

Partial credit, probabilistic scoring, and subjective interpretation are not permitted.

A scenario either satisfies its invariants or it does not.

### 6.6 Determinism Requirement

For any fixed:
	•	scenario definition,
	•	canonical inputs,
	•	conformance level,
	•	engine configuration (L1–L2),
	•	node topology (L4),

repeated executions MUST produce:
	•	identical assertion outcomes,
	•	identical canonical exports,
	•	identical evidence_hash values.

Determinism is a conformance requirement, not an optimization goal.

### 6.7 Conformance Claim

An implementation MAY claim conformance to a specific PCS level only if:
	1.	All scenarios for that level and lower levels pass.
	2.	Evidence Bundles are generated.
	3.	evidence_hash values are stable across repeated execution.
	4.	Platform invariance is demonstrated across supported runtime versions.

Conformance claims without reproducible evidence artifacts are invalid.

Implementations claiming L4 conformance MUST provide an automated freeze gate that:
	•	executes all L4 scenarios across multiple iterations,
	•	asserts a 100% pass rate,
	•	verifies stable evidence_hash,
	•	verifies all scope-enforcement tests pass.

### 6.8 Separation of Specification and Implementation

The Evidence Contract governs observable behavior, not internal architecture.

PCS does not prescribe:
	•	storage engines,
	•	database technologies,
	•	inference engine vendors,
	•	orchestration frameworks.

It prescribes only the externally verifiable invariants defined by the conformance levels.

## 7. What PCS Is Not

PCS defines a conformance standard governing deterministic cognitive state invariants. It is intentionally narrow. The following clarifications eliminate common category mappings.

### 7.1 Not a Database

PCS is not a database system.
It does not define storage engines, indexing strategies, query languages, or transaction models.

While PCS-conformant implementations may use databases internally, PCS does not guarantee generic data durability or query semantics. It guarantees only the preservation and enforcement of defined cognitive state invariants.

Durability is necessary but not sufficient for PCS conformance.

### 7.2 Not a Distributed Consensus Protocol

PCS is not a consensus algorithm.
It does not define leader election, quorum rules, partition tolerance, or Byzantine fault handling.

L4 conformance validates survivability under single-node loss with explicit replication semantics. It does not define or require majority-based agreement or network partition resolution.

Consensus protocols may be used beneath PCS implementations, but they are not part of the PCS specification.

### 7.3 Not a Reasoning Engine

PCS does not perform inference.
It does not define model architectures, training regimes, decoding strategies, or reasoning heuristics.

Inference engines remain probabilistic and replaceable. PCS governs the deterministic state layer that persists independently of those engines.

PCS constrains and preserves state; it does not generate cognition.

### 7.4 Not an Embedding Store or Vector Index

PCS does not define semantic search, similarity ranking, or embedding persistence.

Embedding systems retrieve context.
PCS governs persistent cognitive artifacts and their invariants.

Context retrieval and cognitive state preservation are distinct concerns.

### 7.5 Not a Product API

PCS is not a feature framework or application toolkit.
It does not define end-user interfaces, business logic, or domain-specific functionality.

PCS defines conformance properties at the infrastructure layer.

Applications may expose PCS functionality, but PCS itself remains an infrastructure specification.

### 7.6 Not a General State Management Framework

PCS does not attempt to manage arbitrary application state.

It governs a specific category of state artifacts: decisions, policies, and related cognitive invariants.

General distributed state management systems guarantee availability and durability.
PCS defines guarantees over cognitive identity and enforcement semantics.

## 8. Why Existing Infrastructure Does Not Solve This

Distributed systems infrastructure provides mature guarantees around durability, replication, and availability. These guarantees are necessary for reliable systems operation. They are not sufficient for preserving cognitive state invariants.

PCS addresses a distinct problem domain.

### 8.1 Durability Is Not Cognitive Continuity

Databases guarantee that data written to storage can be retrieved later.
They do not guarantee that a decision retains identity across inference engine transitions.

A stored record may survive process restarts or replication events.
PCS requires that a decision’s identity, semantics, and enforceability remain invariant when the underlying inference engine changes.

Durability preserves bytes.
Cognitive continuity preserves identity.

### 8.2 Replication Is Not Deterministic Governance

Distributed databases replicate state across nodes to ensure availability.
They do not define enforcement semantics for policies embedded within probabilistic inference systems.

Replication guarantees that a record exists in multiple locations.
PCS requires that a policy be deterministically enforced regardless of which inference engine or node processes a request.

Availability does not imply governance invariance.

### 8.3 Consensus Is Not Engine Independence

Consensus protocols guarantee agreement among nodes.
They do not define invariants across heterogeneous inference engines.

A consensus system may agree on stored values while the behavior of the reasoning engine interpreting those values changes across versions or model swaps.

PCS defines conformance properties that persist across inference engine replacement.
Engine independence is not a property of consensus protocols.

### 8.4 Context Retrieval Is Not Persistent Identity

Vector databases and embedding stores provide semantic retrieval of context.
They do not define persistent cognitive artifacts with stable identifiers and enforcement semantics.

Similarity-based retrieval may return relevant historical information.
PCS requires deterministic identity preservation for decisions and policies, independent of retrieval heuristics.

Context retrieval assists inference.
Persistent identity constrains it.

### 8.5 Availability Is Not Survivability of Cognitive State

High-availability systems ensure continued service under node failure.
They do not define guarantees that cognitive state invariants remain intact and enforceable under those failures.

PCS L4 defines survivability under explicit node loss with verified state convergence and invariant preservation.

Service availability is not equivalent to cognitive state survivability.

### Summary

Distributed databases guarantee durability, replication, and availability.
They do not guarantee decision identity preservation across inference engines, deterministic policy enforcement semantics, or cognitive continuity invariants.

PCS defines those guarantees.

## 9. Implementation Independence

PCS is defined as a conformance specification, not an implementation.
The standard governs observable behavior and invariant preservation. It does not prescribe internal architecture.

Any system that satisfies the conformance requirements defined in Section 5 and produces valid Evidence Bundles as defined in Section 6 is PCS-conformant, regardless of implementation strategy.

### 9.1 Storage Independence

PCS does not mandate a particular storage backend.

Conformant implementations MAY use:
	•	Embedded file storage
	•	Relational databases
	•	Key–value stores
	•	Distributed data grids
	•	Custom storage engines

The storage mechanism is not evaluated directly.
Conformance is determined solely by externally verifiable invariants:
	•	Canonical export determinism
	•	Identity preservation
	•	Deterministic enforcement semantics
	•	Verified replication convergence (L4+)

Internal storage design is implementation-specific.

### 9.2 Inference Engine Independence

PCS does not mandate a specific inference engine, model provider, or architecture.

A PCS-conformant system MAY operate with:
	•	Hosted API-based models
	•	Self-hosted open-weight models
	•	Fine-tuned proprietary engines
	•	Heterogeneous engines across nodes

The inference engine is treated as a swappable component behind a defined interface.

Engine replacement MUST NOT violate:
	•	Decision identity invariants
	•	Policy enforcement semantics
	•	Evidence contract determinism

Inference engines may vary in capability, cost, or performance.
They may not alter PCS-defined invariants.

### 9.3 Orchestration Independence

PCS does not prescribe orchestration topology beyond the conformance level requirements.

L4 requires demonstrable survivability under single-node loss in a three-node topology.
It does not mandate cluster managers, leader election, background replication, or automatic failover mechanisms.

Higher-order distributed strategies may be implemented.
They are not required for PCS conformance.

### 9.4 Implementation Surface Boundaries

PCS defines a minimal external interface sufficient to verify invariants:
	•	Invocation interface
	•	Canonical state export
	•	Canonical state import
	•	State hash derivation
	•	Health verification (L4+)

Implementations MAY expose additional internal APIs.
These are outside the scope of PCS conformance.

The conformance boundary is defined by observable behavior, not internal design.

### 9.5 Integration Depth Levels

PCS-conformant implementations may integrate with inference engines at varying depths.

Prompt-mediated integration injects cognitive state through the engine’s standard input interface.

Training-integrated implementations expose PCS interfaces as native engine capabilities, reducing orchestration overhead while maintaining identical conformance guarantees.

Integration depth affects efficiency and coupling.
It does not alter conformance semantics.

### Summary

Implementation freedom is deliberate.

PCS defines what must hold true.
It does not constrain how it is achieved.

Conformance is determined by invariant preservation, not architectural preference.

## 10. Future Extensions (Non-Core PCS)

PCS conformance is defined through Level 4.
Higher-order distributed properties are deliberately excluded from the core specification.

Future extension classes (L5+) include:
	•	L5-A: Partition Detection and Deterministic Rejoin
	•	L5-B: Quorum-Based Write Acknowledgment
	•	L5-C: Leader Election
	•	L5-D: Byzantine Fault Tolerance
	•	L5-E: Multi-Region Deployment Semantics

These properties are well-studied in distributed systems engineering.
They address availability, coordination, and adversarial resilience.

PCS does not require these guarantees to establish deterministic cognitive state invariants.

The L4 boundary is intentional.
It isolates the minimal distributed conditions necessary to prove that cognitive state survives process failure and replication events without redefining classical distributed systems theory.

Future extensions may formalize additional guarantees.
They do not alter the invariants defined in Levels 1–4.
 PCS relocates where durable cognition lives in the AI stack.
